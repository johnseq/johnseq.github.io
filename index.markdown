I work on various neuroimaging solutions related to human brain development. I am interested in MRI brain image analysis during the perinatal period and write tools to analyze both postmorterm and in vivo high resolution images. I enjoy collaborting with people from various scientific backgrounds.


# Research Interests

The Zolle Lab is pursuing research in algorithm development related to perinatal brain MRI image
analysis, both for in vivo and ex vivo acquisitions. We have focused a lot on
various spatial registration projects and also on diffusion weighted image
analysis.


Dr Zollei is one of the founding members of FIT'NG (Fetal, infant and toddler
neuroimaging). Find out more at [FitNG](https://groups.io/g/fitng) or follow us on
